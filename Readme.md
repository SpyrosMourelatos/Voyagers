Hi fellow Omega Squad and Secret Overloard of the Universe named Thanos
This is your friend Andy de'l Mour speaking and this is my mind palace

## To use 
You have to install git and (optionally but strongly recomended) Obsidian.
Git is a version control programm that we use to sync files between various devices , it is quite tedious to download on android and ios
but it is easy on any other device.
Obsidian is a program that can read my wizadly conventions of storing data and translate it to something usefull for other people.
My only conventions is that `[[a]]` is a link to a file named `a` and the file structure is a categorization of my thoughts, feel free to navigate
the folders and files whichever way you like.
